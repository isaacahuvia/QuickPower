\title{Determining required sample size with two means of equal n}
\usage{
SampleSize_Means(populationmean = NULL, populationdev = NULL,
  effectsize = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  treatmentrate = 1, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, d = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{populationmean}{The population mean for the statistic in question. Required for all analyses.}

\item{populationdev}{The population standard deviation for the statistic in question. Required for all analyses.}

\item{effectsize}{The difference in means between the treatment group and the base rate. Can be a single integer \code{x} or a combination of integers \code{c(x1, x2, etc)}. This is a "practical" effect size; see details.}

\item{alternative}{The type of hypothesis. Can be \code{"greater"} (treatment mean > control mean), \code{"less"} (treatment mean < control mean), or \code{"two.sided"} (treatment mean != control mean).}

\item{treatmentrate}{The proportion of those in the treatment group who are expected to complete treatment; see details.}

\item{sig.level}{The significance level of the hypothetical test. Defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{power}{The power of the hypothetical test. Defaults to \code{0.8}.}

\item{d}{Refers to Cohen's d, the formal score for effect size in tests of means. You may supply a Cohen's d score instead of a practical effect size if you prefer.}

\description{
This function runs power calculations with two means of equal n, determining what sample size is necessary to see a statistically significant effect. Results are printed and can also be assigned.
}
\details{
The effect size input is a "practical" effect size in that it is the
difference in means in observed units, unlike Cohen's d. The calculations
adjust for treatment rate, so consider the effect size the mean effect among
those who successfully receive treatment.

The treatment rate is used to (crudely) calculate the sample size. Assuming
that those who do not receive treatment will be identical to the control
group, the required sample size will need to be inversely proportional to the
treatment rate. That is, a completed treatment is worth an effect size of 1,
but only 90% of the treatment group receives treatment, the mean effect size
for the treatment group will only be .9. This means that the n will need to
be higher than it would if the treatment rate was 1.

In the output, Cohen's d is calculated after taking treatment rate into
effect. If the treatment rate given to the function is lower than 1, the d
supplied will also be lower, even if all other numbers are constant.

Printed value is rounded; for an unrounded value, assign output to an object.

# QuickPower
QuickPower package (R)

The QuickPower package is designed to produce power calculations quickly and easily, even for users not otherwise familiar with the statistics behind power analysis. Unlike other power analysis packages, this package translates statistical effect sizes into practical terms, allowing the user to conduct analyses without additional commands or calculations. This package is designed to quickly answer the questions of:

> “How many study participants would be needed to see a statistically significant effect of this size?”

and

> “How large of an effect size would be needed to be see a statistically significant result given this number of study participants?”

For more complex power analysis tasks, other packages and techniques should be used.

Description: This package is designed to produce power calculations quickly
    and easily, even for users not otherwise familiar with the statistics behind
    power analysis. Unlike other power analysis packages, this package translates
    statistical effect sizes into practical terms, allowing the user to conduct
    analyses without additional commands or calculations. This package is designed to quickly
    answer the questions of: "How many study participants would be needed to see a
    statistically significant effect of this size?" and "How large of an effect size
    would be needed to be see a statistically significant result given this number
    of study participants?" For more complex power analysis tasks, other packages
    and techniques should be used. This package uses the separate package "pwr" to
    conduct the core calculations.
